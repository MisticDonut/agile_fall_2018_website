    <h1>My Name is Cole Kulig</h1>
    <p>Back at it again with school, this time it's the Last semester! My name is Cole Kulig
      and I have lived in Eau Claire on the north side which put me through all the north 
      "named" schools.  I was never a person to play many sports, so when I was younger I 
      played a lot of video games and watched TV. I graduated from CVTC in 2014 in the 
      Information Technology: Network Specialist program. Now I am continuing with the 
      Software/Programming programs. I might possibly research studying video game development as well.
