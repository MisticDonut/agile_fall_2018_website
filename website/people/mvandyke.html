      Hello all, my name is Michael Van Dyke, but most people call me Mike. I am currently in my last 
      semester at CVTC in the IT - Software Developer program, and I am planning on going to UW-Stout 
      this spring for ICT after getting my associate degree. I have lived my whole life in Wisconsin 
      and grew up in Glenwood City. I am currently employed at Menards as a computer hardware support 
      intern. I am a pretty big fan of trying different beers and scotches, and I like cooking. I also 
      really enjoy playing board games, tabletop games, video games, and almost any other type of game 
      with friends. Currently, I am on a League of Legends kick, and have also been playing a lot of 
      Pathfinder. I look forward to getting to know all the new people as the semester goes on!
